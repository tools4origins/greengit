#### Do you wonder why this repository is so active?

##### After all it has 27101 commits!

But is it *really* active? Well...

##### Last update was on Thu Mar 17 at 01:25:10 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it certainly helps a lot to have such an active repo!

Oh and there was **26%** disk usage on the machine
where there is the cron updating this file.

Not the best way to monitor a VM in the cloud but it works! :)
