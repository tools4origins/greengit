#### Do you wonder why this repository is so active?

##### After all it has 4806 commits!

But is it *really* active? Well...

##### Last update was on Sat Aug 31 at 02:25:01 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it certainly helps a lot to have such an active repo!

Oh and there was **53%** disk usage on the machine
where there is the cron updating this file.

Not the best way to monitor a VM in the cloud but it works! :)
