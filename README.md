# Greengit

Do you wonder why this repository is so active?

After all it has 4 commits!

But is it *really* active? Well...

Last update was on Tue Jan 29 at 18:06:34 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it helps a lot to have such an active repo :)

Oh and there was 61% disk usage on the machine
where there is the cron to update this file

Not the best way to monitor a VM in the cloud but it works :)
