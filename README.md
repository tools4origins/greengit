#### Do you wonder why this repository is so active?

##### After all it has 10886 commits!

But is it *really* active? Well...

##### Last update was on Sun May 10 at 10:25:03 when those lines were... generated

Yes, generated, because it certainly helps a lot to have such an active repo!

Oh and there was **23%** disk usage on the machine
where there is the cron updating this file.

Not the best way to monitor a VM in the cloud but it works! :)
